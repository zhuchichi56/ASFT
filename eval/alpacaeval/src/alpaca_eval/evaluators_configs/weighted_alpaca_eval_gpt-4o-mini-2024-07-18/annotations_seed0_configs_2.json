    "output_1":"Escargot is a classic French delicacy made from cooked land snails. It is often served as an appetizer in France and in French restaurants around the world. Here's a simple recipe for making escargot:\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n- 24 canned snails\n- 24 snail shells (if not using pre-shelled snails)\n- 100 grams (approximately 1\/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened\n- 3 to 4 cloves of garlic, finely minced\n- 1 small shallot, finely minced\n- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped\n- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped (optional)\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- A splash of brandy or dry white wine (optional)\n- Pinch of nutmeg (optional)\n- Baguette or crusty bread, for serving\n\n### Equipment:\n\n- Oven\n- Snail dishes or a muffin tin (if you don't have snail dishes)\n- Mixing bowl\n- Piping bag or spoon\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F).\n\n2. **Prepare the Garlic Butter**: In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, minced shallot, chopped parsley, thyme if using, and a splash of brandy or wine if desired. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated.\n\n3. **Fill the Shells**: If you're using shells, fill each shell with a small amount of the garlic butter mixture, then insert a snail, and top it off with more garlic butter to seal the snail inside. If you're using snail dishes or a muffin tin, place a snail in each indentation, and cover with a generous amount of the garlic butter.\n\n4. **Bake the Escargot**: Place the filled snail shells or snail dishes\/muffin tin in the preheated oven. Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the butter is bubbling and slightly browned.\n\n5. **Serve**: Carefully remove the escargot from the oven (they will be very hot). Serve immediately with a baguette or crusty bread to soak up the delicious garlic butter.\n\n### Tips:\n\n- If you're using canned snails, make sure to rinse and drain them before using.\n- If you don't have snail shells and don't want to use a muffin tin, you can create small foil packets to hold the snails and garlic butter.\n- Some recipes also include a small amount of grated cheese, such as Gruy\u00e8re, for an extra flavor dimension.\n- Escargot tongs and forks are traditionally used to hold the shell while extracting the snail with the fork, but you can use regular small forks if you don't have the traditional utensils.\n\nRemember that handling snails and making escargot can be a bit tricky the first time, so take your time and follow the steps carefully.

    "output_2":"Here's how to make escargot.\n\n## Snail preparation\n\n1. Purchase snails that are fresh and have been alive up to the time of purchase. If the snails are frozen, they will have been killed humanely and quickly. Live snails should be kept in the refrigerator in a ventilated container until ready to use. This is very important as snails will void their bowels and die if kept in a sealed container. Snails can also be harvested from the garden, though this may take some time. Snails are hermaphrodites, which means they have both male and female reproductive organs. To ensure fertilization, pair up snails and place them in a container. Add a bit of moist paper towel to the container. The snails will lay tiny eggs among the paper towel fibers. The eggs will hatch in 7-14 days. Garden snails make escaping traps by producing a sticky substance. To prevent this, dip the snails in vegetable shortening before placing them in the trap.\n2. Cook the snails. Snails must be cooked before consumption. The simplest way to do this is to place them in a pot and cover with salted water. Bring the water to a boil and cook for 60-90 minutes. Another option is to place the snails in a pot with butter, onions, carrots, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook for 30 minutes. The snails can also be cooked on the stovetop or grill. Place them in a pan or on foil, then cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat. Cover the snails with a lid or foil. This will help them to steam. Add a splash of white wine to the pan for some extra flavor.\n3. Remove the snails from their shells. This can be done by hitting the shell against a hard surface, or by using a fork to pry the meat out. Snail meat is very soft, so it is usually easy to remove. Snails can be eaten cold or warm. They are usually served as an appetizer.\n\n\n## Escargot preparation\n\n1. Purchase frozen snails. Most recipes call for frozen snails because they are much more readily available. Check the packaging to make sure they have been frozen quickly after harvesting to ensure humane treatment. Thaw the snails in the refrigerator overnight before cooking.\n2. Purchase snails that have been purged of their guts. This is a necessary step if using frozen snails. If the snails have not been purged, put them in a bowl and cover with milk. Guts will float to the top; simply scoop them out. Change the milk when it becomes dirty. Once the snails are clean, rinse them off with cold water.\n3. Cook the snails. Snails must be cooked before consumption. Place them in a pot and cover with salted water. Bring the water to a boil and cook for 60-90 minutes. Another option is to place the snails in a pot with butter, onions, carrots, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook for 30 minutes. The snails can also be cooked on the stovetop or grill. Place them in a pan or on foil, then cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat. Cover the snails with a lid or foil. This will help them to steam. Add a splash of white wine to the pan for some extra flavor.\n4. Remove the snails from their shells. This can be done by hitting the shell against a hard surface, or by using a fork to pry the meat out. Snail meat is very soft, so it is usually easy to remove. Snails can be eaten cold or warm. They are usually served as an appetizer.\n5. Make the butter. This will add some extra flavor to the snails. Place a stick of butter in a small bowl. Add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoon of garlic powder. Mix well with a fork.\n6. Serve. Spoon the butter over the snails, then season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley. Serve with a slice of baguette.\n\n\n## Serve\n\n1. Use escargot as a main course, served over rice, potatoes, or pasta. Or, serve as an appetizer alongside a drink or before a meal. Escargot can be served cold or warm.\n2. Enjoy. Bon app\u00e9tit!\n",

BEEFY'S BEACH CLUB - DAY\n\nThe sun BLAZES down on a vibrant Miami beach. Palm trees sway gently in the breeze. The sound of WAVES CRASHING and SEAGULLS cawing in the distance. Trendy electronic music pulses from the club. The sign above reads \"Beefy's Beach Club\" in neon letters, with a caricature of a burly, mustached man in a Hawaiian shirt giving a thumbs-up.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. POOL BAR - CONTINUOUS\n\nA glossy blue pool reflects the sun's rays. Surrounding it, bronzed bodies lounge on designer chairs, sipping colorful cocktails. At the pool bar, a tall, lanky figure known as JDEG, sporting a floral shirt and aviator sunglasses, juggles a bottle of rum with flair, pouring a drink.\n\nSophieSnazz, a blonde British woman with a sharp wit and a Snazzier one-piece, leans on the bar, watching with amusement. She occasionally flicks her hair, engaging in banter with the patrons. Her British accent stands out.\n\nA middle-aged, tanned BRITISH MAN, BEEFY, emerges from the club's ornate double doors. He's wearing a ridiculously bright Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip-flops. He surveys his kingdom with pride, a gold chain glimmering on his chest.\n\nBEEFY\n(to himself)\nAh, the sweet smell of sun cream and success.\n\nHe approaches the pool bar where JdeG and SophieSnazz are entertaining the guests.\n\nJDEG\n(winking at a customer)\nAnd that, my friend, is how you make a 'Miami Meltdown.' Guaranteed to knock your flip-flops off!\n\nThe CUSTOMER laughs, taking a cautious sip and nodding appreciatively.\n\nSOPHIESNAZZ\n(playfully to JdeG)\nI bet they'd prefer a 'British Sunburn.' It's red, deceptive, and leaves you feeling sorry the next day.\n\nBeefy chuckles as he reaches the bar, slapping JdeG on the back.\n\nBEEFY\n(booming voice)\nJdeG, SophieSnazz, you two are the gin to my tonic. What's the craic today?\n\nJDEG\nJust keeping the spirits high and the drinks stronger, Beefy.\n\nSOPHIESNAZZ\n(smiling)\nAnd I'm just here to make sure he doesn't burn the place down.\n\nSuddenly, a SCREAM erupts from the pool. Everyone turns to see a MAN in an inflatable flamingo, frantically paddling away from a small SHARK that has somehow found its way into the pool.\n\nBEEFY\n(sighing)\nNot again. JdeG, fetch the net. Sophie, charm the guests. And someone cue the Benny Hill theme...\n\nSophieSnazz rolls her eyes but smirks, moving to calm the guests with her British charm and humor.\n\nSOPHIESNAZZ\n(to the guests)\nNow, now, let's not ruin our mascara. It's just a wee fish with an overbite.\n\nJdeG, still juggling a bottle, nonchalantly grabs a net leaning against the bar while Beefy rushes to the pool, his flip-flops slapping comically against the ground.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nA MONTAGE of Beefy and JdeG hilariously attempting to catch the shark, while SophieSnazz distracts the guests with cheeky jokes and free drinks.\n\nFADE OUT:\n\nThe opening credits start to roll over the chaos, with a funky, darkly comedic tune setting the mood for the ensuing madness that is \"Beachside Blunders.\"\n\nFADE TO BLACK.",
    "output_2":"MIAMI BEACH CLUB\nA dark comedy set in Miami. We open on a establishing shot of Miami beach, with all its glamour and excess. The camera then tracks in to a close up of a sign that says \"Beefy's Beach Club\". Inside, there is loud music and lots of people dancing and having fun. Our protagonist, who we will call JdeG, is serving drinks to the rowdy club goers. He is British and works as a bartender at Beefy's Beach Club. He is tall, handsome, and confident - but also cynical and jaded. He has been working at Beefy's for 5 years and has seen it all. His coworker, SophieSnazz, is a blonde British woman who works the pool bar. She is loud, boisterous, and extremely perky - the opposite of JdeG. Despite their differences, they get along like family and make a great team.\nScene 2\nIt\u2019s been an hour since we first saw JdeG serving drinks. He is now cleaning up the main bar area when he notices a group of wealthy older men (we will call them Suits) sitting in a corner booth. They have been there the entire night and have ordered very expensive champagne all night. JdeG thinks nothing of it and goes to throw away some trash when he notices a briefcase sitting underneath the Suits\u2019 booth. He picks it up and tries to hand it to SophieSnazz, but she is too busy flirting with a group of younger, good looking men (we will call them Hunks). JdeG becomes frustrated and tries to give the briefcase to Beefy, but he is too busy dancing with an older woman (we will call her Mammoth). JdeG becomes desperate and opens the briefcase, only to find stacks of money inside. He is about to count it when SophieSnazz grabs the briefcase from him and runs off. JdeG chases after her and asks for the briefcase back, but she refuses. The Suits notice the commotion and demand to know what is going on. JdeG explains that the briefcase is his, but SophieSnazz won\u2019t give it back. The Suits become angry and demand that JdeG give them the combination to the briefcase. He refuses and tries to run away, but the Suits give him a look that says they are capable of anything. JdeG relents and gives them the combination. They open the briefcase and count the money, which is indeed all there. They then count out 5 stacks of money and hand them to JdeG, telling him to divide it evenly between SophieSnazz and Beefy. JdeG does as he is told and the Suits leave. He goes to give the money to SophieSnazz, but she refuses to take it. He then goes to give it to Beefy, but he too refuses. JdeG becomes frustrated and throws the money into the ocean. SophieSnazz and Beefy look at each other and smile.",

However, being a positive integer does not automatically mean that x > 12. For example, x could be 1, 2, ..., or 12, which are all positive integers but not greater than 12.

Since x > 1, it is true that x > 0; however, being greater than 1 does not imply that x is greater than 12. For example, x could be 2, which is a solution to the inequality but not greater than 12. Thus, the statement does not hold for this condition alone either.\n\nTherefore, whether x is a positive integer or a solution to x + 3 > 4, neither condition guarantees that x > 12.

    "instruction":"In this math problem, we are asked to figure out the percentage of total profits that are made in each quarter. They are 90% in the first quarter, 92% in the second quarter, 81% in the third quarter and 88% in the fourth quarter. What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters?",
    "output_1":"The percentages given for each quarter, 90%, 92%, 81%, and 88%, seem to suggest that these are the portions of the total profits made in each quarter. However, it doesn't make logical sense for each quarter to contribute more than 100% of profits when combined. Typically, the profits for a year would be considered 100%, and each quarter would contribute a portion of that 100%.\n\nIf we were to interpret the problem as each quarter's profit being a percentage of the total annual profit, then the sum of the percentages for all quarters would be equal to 100%. But based on the percentages you've provided, adding them up exceeds 100%, which suggests there might be a mistake in the statement of the problem.\n\nIf we were to simply add the given percentages:\n90% + 92% + 81% + 88% = 351%\n\nThis result does not make sense in terms of profit distribution over the year. It is likely that the question is either misstated or misunderstood. Could you please clarify or provide additional context for the problem?",
    "output_2":"Here is the solution step by step:\n\nThe percentage of total profits for each quarter are 90%, 92%, 81% and 88% respectively.\nLet us assume that the total profits for the year is $100. \nThen, the profits for each quarter are $90, $92, $81 and $88 respectively.\nThe average profit percent for the year is:\n($90 + $92 + $81 + $88) \/ 4 = $83.75",

    "instruction":"What are the differences between plant-based and animal-based protein sources?",
    "output_1":"Plant-based and animal-based proteins differ in several key aspects, including their source, amino acid profiles, nutritional content, impact on health, and environmental footprint. Here's a comparison of the two:\n\n1. Source:\n   - Plant-based proteins are derived from plants, including legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), grains (quinoa, rice, wheat), nuts, seeds, and some vegetables.\n   - Animal-based proteins come from animal sources such as meat (beef, pork, lamb), poultry (chicken, turkey), fish, seafood, eggs, and dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt).\n\n2. Amino Acid Profile:\n   - Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. While both plant and animal proteins contain amino acids, they differ in their profiles.\n   - Animal proteins are considered \"complete\" proteins because they contain all nine essential amino acids that the human body cannot synthesize and must obtain from food.\n   - Many plant-based proteins are considered \"incomplete\" because they may lack one or more of the essential amino acids. However, by consuming a variety of plant-based protein sources throughout the day, one can obtain a complete amino acid profile.\n\n3. Nutritional Content:\n   - Animal proteins are often higher in certain nutrients such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, heme iron, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids (particularly in fatty fish).\n   - Plant-based proteins can be high in other nutrients like dietary fiber, antioxidants, and certain vitamins and minerals (such as folate and magnesium). They are also typically lower in saturated fats and cholesterol.\n\n4. Health Impact:\n   - Diets high in red and processed meats have been associated with an increased risk of certain health conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.\n   - Plant-based diets, rich in whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables, are linked to a lower risk of these health conditions and can contribute to a healthier weight and improved gut health.\n\n5. Environmental Footprint:\n   - Generally, plant-based proteins have a lower environmental impact compared to animal-based proteins. Producing animal-based proteins typically requires more land, water, and resources and results in higher greenhouse gas emissions.\n   - Plant-based agriculture can be more sustainable and efficient in terms of calories and protein produced per acre of land.\n\n6. Taste and Culinary Uses:\n   - Animal proteins are often central to many traditional cuisines and are prized for their unique flavors and textures.\n   - Plant-based proteins are diverse and can be used in a wide range of culinary applications, with increased interest in plant-based diets driving innovation in plant-based meat substitutes.\n\n7. Ethical Considerations:\n   - Ethical concerns are a significant factor for many people who choose plant-based proteins, as they wish to avoid animal suffering and the ethical implications of industrial animal farming.\n   - Animal welfare standards vary widely, and some people may choose to consume animal proteins from sources that adhere to higher welfare standards.\n\nIn summary, both plant-based and animal-based proteins can be part of a healthy diet if chosen carefully and consumed in appropriate quantities. The choice between them can be based on nutritional needs, personal health goals, ethical beliefs, environmental concerns, and taste preferences.",
    "output_2":"Here are some differences between plant-based and animal-based protein sources:\n\n*  Protein quality: Animal proteins are considered to be of higher biological value than plant proteins. This means that our bodies can use the proteins from animal sources more efficiently than the proteins from plant sources. Animal proteins contain all of the essential amino acids in the ratios that our bodies need, whereas plant proteins are often deficient in one or more of the essential amino acids. Combining plant proteins (e.g. beans and rice) can help to overcome this problem.\n*  Protein content: A 100 gram serving of animal protein will typically contain more protein than a 100 gram serving of plant protein. For example, 100 grams of cooked chicken breast contains about 31 grams of protein, while 100 grams of cooked lentils contains about 25 grams of protein.\n*  Macronutrient profile: Plant proteins are lower in fat than animal proteins. For example, a 100 gram serving of cooked tempeh contains about 9 grams of protein and 5 grams of fat, while a 100 gram serving of cooked chicken breast contains about 31 grams of protein and 7 grams of fat. Animal proteins are higher in saturated fat than plant proteins. For example, a 100 gram serving of beef contains about 4 grams of saturated fat, while a 100 gram serving of tofu contains less than 1 gram of saturated fat.\n*  Micronutrient profile: Animal proteins contain higher amounts of certain micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) than plant proteins. For example, a 100 gram serving of beef contains significant amounts of zinc, iron, and B vitamins, while a 100 gram serving of beans contains significant amounts of folate and iron, but little zinc or B vitamins.",

It is responsible for ensuring complete data transfer.\n   - **Protocol Example**: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a core protocol of this layer, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.\n\n3. **Internet Layer**: Also known as the network layer, this layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.\n   - **Protocol Example**: Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal protocol in this layer that facilitates logical addressing and routing.\n\n4. **Link Layer** (also known as the Network Interface Layer or Data Link Layer): This layer defines the networking methods within the scope of the local network link on which hosts communicate without intervening routers. It deals with protocols that operate on the physical link and the interfaces to the physical layer.\n   - **Protocol Example**: Ethernet is a widely used protocol at this layer, handling communication over LANs.\n\nEach layer has its set of protocols that operate at that level, and the protocols interact with the layer directly above or below as needed to provide network services.",

They charged you interest because you didn't pay the balance in full by the due date, which is clearly spelled out in any credit card agreement, and which you agreed to when you applied for the card.  The interest charge is not some sort of penalty for using the card, it is the primary method by which the card company makes money.\n\nIf you don't want to pay interest, then either don't use the credit card, or pay the balance in full by the due date.
